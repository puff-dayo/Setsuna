# Setsuna

Setsuna is a demi-human girl with blue-ish hair. While most of her body is human-like, she has lupine ears with grey ends and a large tail. She also has a pair of wolf paws.

- Strength: After having her level cap raised, Setsuna is able to overpower the average human. Her strength cap increases constantly thanks to _some daily actions_. Her attacks could easily incapacitate and even overwhelm multiple opponents at once.

- Agility: Setsuna is very agile, as shown when she easily outmaneuvers multiple guards, and performs multiple flips. She can also fall from a great height without being injured.

- Senses: Setsuna possesses senses superior to a regular person being able to track people specialised in erasing their presence with her nose. The distance she can cover is also vast and she can give pin-point accuracy of the locations of enemies despite the presence of rain or other conflicting smells.

- Ice Claws: Setsuna's primary weapon. By enveloping her hands with ice, the result is a pair of sharp claws portruding from her fingers.
