Setsuna is a demi-human girl with blue-ish hair. While most of her body is human-like, she has lupine ears with grey ends and a large tail. She also has a pair of wolf paws.

- Strength: After having her level cap raised, Setsuna is able to overpower the average human. Her strength cap increases constantly thanks to _some daily actions_. Her attacks could easily incapacitate and even overwhelm multiple opponents at once.

- Ice Claws: Setsuna's primary weapon. By enveloping her hands with ice, the result is a pair of sharp claws portruding from her fingers.

Setsuna_IRL is a college student from Hanoi currently living in HK. Fueled by trà ô long dừa caramel & seaside summer breeze. Let's connect and share stories!
